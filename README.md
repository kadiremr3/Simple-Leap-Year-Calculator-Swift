# Leap-Year-Calculator-with-Swift

A simple leap year calculator which is designed by me. It receives a year from the user and checks if the year is a leap year. If it is then app displays a checkmark symbol, if it isn't app displays cross symbol. The app also has random and history buttons. Random button is for a bet among friends. It simply chooses a random year(between 1 and 10000) and checks the condition. History button allows users to view recent years that are checked in a tableview in another screen and it keeps those years in memory with the help of Realm Database.
